# Exponentis

A web app that teaches high school level math. Each lesson features a 'key concept' modal explaining the subject, e.g., quadratics, and sets of modals containing a step-by-step example followed by a practice exercise modeled after the example. Users can sign in and save their progress; whenever they submit the correct answer to a practice exercise, a green check mark appears next to the 'example + practice' button and the progress bar is updated.
